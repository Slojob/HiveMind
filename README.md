HiveMind inspires seamless peer collaboration by allowing our users to think and learn as one.

We achieve this mindset through an emphasis on collective functionality and uniformity of design.

Collective functionality was approached by defining the role and purpose of each function. We have defined all functionality into two groups, “Work” and “Discuss”. Our focus was uncomplicating the system with unneeded navigation and by strengthening the purpose of each task by grouping them into their similar portions. Each user is also encouraged to focus on the collective portion of peer review by placing them on the discussion page first. We aimed to facilitate these questions and commentary further by placing the notifications on feedback requested and received on the same page motivating users to collaborate. The interface chosen for feedback is inspired by Grammarly. We encourage with our intuitive feedback system allowing users to highlight the sections of work they are reviewing. The group can then ensure that all feedback is constructive by commenting or by indicating which is their favourite. Only positive reinforcement is available in order to support a positive group dynamic.
Our uniformity of design focuses on team collaboration by utilizing a minimalist approach with clear indicators to platform conventions. We are aiming to facilitate conversation by minimising the time taken to become familiar with the system. These inspirations come similar work systems like Microsoft Word or Facebook messenger. Our iconography seeks to inspire a familiar sentiment, overcoming a learning curve with interface standards users are familiar with. 
The two button navigation system allows you traverse into either one of the two environments in the system with familiar icons. These icons are clear references to functionality users are already comfortable with, specifically utilizing the similar “Document” icon utilized in Microsoft Word or other work environments and the “Chat Bubble” utilized in Facebook Messenger. These are two of the examples of uniform design coalescing with interface standards users are familiar with.
